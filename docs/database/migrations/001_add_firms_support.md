What This Migration Does: ✅ Core Tables Created:

firms - Multi-tenant firm entities with complete business information user_firm_assignments -
Many-to-many relationship allowing accountants to work for multiple firms schema_migrations - Tracks
applied migrations (like Rails/Laravel migrations)

✅ Existing Tables Enhanced:

Adds firm_id columns to: properties, owners, tenants, vendors, expense_categories, expense_types All
foreign key constraints properly established Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

✅ Business Logic Added:

Helper functions for firm context switching (get_user_firm_context) Access validation functions
(user_has_firm_access) Automatic timestamp triggers for audit trails Multi-tenant data isolation
support

✅ Data Migration Handled:

Creates "Default Property Management" firm for existing data Migrates all existing entities to the
default firm Creates user-firm assignments for existing users Zero data loss during migration

Key Features Implemented:

1. Admin Portal Support: sql-- Admins can create multiple firms and toggle between them -- Each firm
   has complete business profile and branding SELECT \* FROM get_user_firm_context(admin_user_id);
2. Multi-Firm Accountant Support: sql-- Accountants can be assigned to multiple firms -- Secure firm
   context switching INSERT INTO user_firm_assignments (user_id, firm_id, role_in_firm);
3. Data Isolation: sql-- All entities now belong to specific firms -- Cross-firm data access
   prevented by design SELECT \* FROM properties WHERE firm_id = user_current_firm_id; How to
   Execute:
4. Backup Your Database: bashpg_dump rems > rems_backup_before_migration_001.sql
5. Run the Migration: bashpsql -U postgres -d rems -f 001_add_firms_support.sql
6. Verify Success: sql-- Check if migration was applied SELECT \* FROM schema_migrations WHERE
   version = '001';

-- Verify firm data SELECT \* FROM firm_overview;

-- Verify user assignments SELECT \* FROM user_firm_details; Expected Output: NOTICE: Starting
Migration 001: Add Firms Support NOTICE: Creating firms table... NOTICE: Firms table created
successfully NOTICE: Creating user_firm_assignments table... NOTICE: User firm assignments table
created successfully NOTICE: Adding firm_id columns to existing tables... NOTICE: Existing data
migrated to default firm (ID: 1) NOTICE: ✅ Migration 001 completed successfully! Safety Features:
✅ Idempotent: Can be run multiple times safely ✅ Rollback Ready: Complete rollback instructions
included ✅ Data Preservation: All existing data migrated to default firm ✅ Constraint Validation:
All business rules properly enforced Next Steps: Once this migration is successful, you can proceed
with:

Test the firm creation functionality using the new tables Run migration 002 for ownership model
enhancements Update your seed data to include additional sample firms

Would you like me to create the second migration file (002_enhance_ownership_model.sql) next, or
would you prefer to test this first migration thoroughly? Also, would you like me to update your
seed.sql file to include sample firms that work with this new multi-tenant structure?
