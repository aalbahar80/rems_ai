What This Migration Accomplishes: ✅ Core Ownership Enhancements:

1. Firm-Default Ownership (Accountant Portal Requirement): sql-- Properties can now exist without
   individual owners -- System automatically assigns 100% firm ownership -- Accountants can add
   properties first, assign owners later
2. Flexible Ownership Assignment:

Mixed Ownership: Properties can have both firm and individual ownership Percentage Validation:
Prevents over-allocation (>100%) with helpful error messages Visual Calculator Support: Backend
functions ready for frontend pie chart integration

3. Advanced Ownership Operations:

Ownership Transfers: Move percentage between owners with full validation Automatic Calculations:
Real-time percentage validation and error messages Historical Tracking: All ownership changes
preserved with timestamps and reasons

✅ Key Functions Implemented: For Accountant Portal: sql-- Validate before assignment SELECT \* FROM
validate_ownership_percentage(property_id, 60.00); -- Returns: is_valid, current_total,
available_percentage, error_message

-- Visual ownership distribution (for pie charts) SELECT \* FROM
get_property_ownership_distribution(property_id); -- Returns: owner_name, firm_name,
ownership_percentage, owned_by_firm For Owner Portal: sql-- Transfer ownership between owners SELECT
transfer_property_ownership(property_id, from_owner, to_owner, 25.00); -- Handles all validation,
percentage adjustments, and record keeping ✅ Business Logic Examples: Accountant Workflow Support:
sql-- Step 1: Create property (auto-gets 100% firm ownership) INSERT INTO properties (property_code,
firm_id, ...) VALUES ('NEW1', 1, ...);

-- Step 2: Later add owner and transfer ownership INSERT INTO owners (full_name, firm_id, ...)
VALUES ('John Smith', 1, ...);

-- Step 3: Transfer ownership from firm to individual SELECT
transfer_property_ownership(property_id, NULL, owner_id, 100.00); Validation Scenarios: sql-- Error
handling for over-allocation INSERT INTO property_ownership_periods (property_id, owner_id,
ownership_percentage) VALUES (1, 2, 75.00); -- If property already 50% owned -- Result: ERROR:
"Cannot assign 75.00%. Only 50.00% available for this property." ✅ Enhanced Views for Frontend:
Portfolio Dashboard Data: sql-- For owner portal dashboard SELECT \* FROM owner_portfolio_overview
WHERE owner_id = current_user_owner_id;

-- For admin firm management  
SELECT \* FROM firm_ownership_analysis WHERE firm_id = current_firm_id;

-- For property overview SELECT \* FROM property_ownership_summary WHERE firm_id = current_firm_id;
Migration Features: ✅ Data Safety:

Preserves all existing ownership data Migrates orphaned properties to firm ownership Maintains
referential integrity Comprehensive validation tests included

✅ Business Intelligence:

Automatic firm ownership assignment for new properties Real-time percentage validation prevents
errors Comprehensive ownership reporting for all portals Transfer audit trail for compliance

✅ Frontend Ready:

Visual calculator backend support (for accountant portal pie charts) Error message system (for
real-time validation) Ownership distribution APIs (for owner portfolio dashboards) Multi-firm
isolation (for admin portal firm switching)

Validation & Testing: The migration includes built-in tests that verify:

✅ All properties have ownership assignment ✅ Percentage validation works correctly ✅ Existing
data migrated successfully ✅ Business logic functions properly
