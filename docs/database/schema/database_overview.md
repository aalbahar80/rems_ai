### **Integration Patterns**

1. **Financial Integration**

   ```
   Properties → Expenses → Approval Workflow → Firm Attribution
   Contracts → Rental Transactions → Invoices → Receipts
   ```

2. **Maintenance Integration**

   ```
   Maintenance Orders → Vendor Assignment → Expense Creation → Approval Routing
   ```

3. **Multi-Tenant Integration**
   ```
   All Entities → Firm Assignment → Data Isolation → User Access Control
   ```

## 💡 Unique System Features

### **1. Firm-Default Ownership System**

**Innovation**: Automatic financial attribution for unassigned property ownership

```sql
-- When property ownership < 100%, system automatically creates:
INSERT INTO property_ownership_periods (
    property_id, owner_id, ownership_type, ownership_percentage
) VALUES (
    property_id, NULL, 'firm_default', remaining_percentage
);

-- Result: All revenue/expenses have clear attribution
-- Individual owners get their share, firm gets remainder
```

**Business Impact**:

- **Revenue**: Rental income for unassigned shares → automatic firm credit
- **Expenses**: Property costs for unassigned portions → automatic firm debit
- **Approval**: Routes to individual owners OR firm admin based on ownership
- **Reporting**: Complete financial accountability with no orphaned transactions

### **2. Intelligent Approval Workflows**

**Smart Routing Logic**:

```sql
-- Approval decision algorithm:
IF property has individual owners (ownership_type='individual') THEN
    Route to specific owner_id for approval
ELSIF property has firm_default ownership THEN
    Route to firm admin for approval
ELSIF expense exceeds delegation threshold THEN
    Escalate to higher authority
ELSIF 72 hours no response THEN
    Auto-escalate to admin
END IF
```

### **3. Polymorphic Design Excellence**

**Universal Relationships**:

- **Invoices**: Can invoice ANY entity type (tenants, vendors, owners, properties)
- **Users**: Dynamically linked to owners, tenants, or vendors
- **Notifications**: Flexible entity association for any business object
