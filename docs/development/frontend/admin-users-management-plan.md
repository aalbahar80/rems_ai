# REMS Admin Portal Users Management Implementation Plan

## Current Status Analysis

✅ **Database Schema**: Comprehensive user management schema analyzed with 6 core tables and 4
analytical views ✅ **Existing Implementation**: The `/admin/users` page does not yet exist - needs
to be created from scratch ✅ **Reference Implementation**: Accountant management system provides
excellent pattern to follow ✅ **Technical Foundation**: API client, authentication, and component
systems are ready

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Users Page Foundation

1. **Create `/frontend/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`**
   - Follow accountants page pattern with data table
   - Use `active_users_summary` view for efficient data loading
   - Implement search, filtering by user type, and pagination

2. **Create User Management Modal Components**
   - `CreateUserModal.tsx` - Multi-step user creation form
   - `ViewUserModal.tsx` - Display user details and session info
   - `EditUserModal.tsx` - Edit user profile and permissions

### Phase 2: Backend API Integration

3. **Extend Users API Endpoints**
   - Enhance existing `/api/v1/users` endpoints
   - Add support for JSONB permissions and settings
   - Implement user type-specific validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

4. **Security & Session Management**
   - User session monitoring using `user_session_analytics` view
   - Account lock/unlock functionality
   - Password reset management

5. **Audit & Analytics Integration**
   - User activity dashboard using `login_analytics` view
   - Change history from `entity_audit_log` table
   - Multi-firm assignment management

### Phase 4: UI/UX Polish

6. **Form Validation & User Experience**
   - Dynamic permission forms based on user type
   - Firm assignment multi-select with role management
   - Real-time session activity indicators

## Key Implementation Details

**Data Sources:**

- Primary: `active_users_summary` view for user list
- Sessions: `user_session_analytics` view for activity monitoring
- Security: `login_analytics` view for security insights
- Audit: `entity_audit_log` table for change tracking

**Component Architecture:**

- Follow established modal-based pattern from accountant management
- Leverage existing UI components (Button, Input, Modal, DataTable)
- Use Zustand store for state management and API integration

**Security Considerations:**

- Role-based access control for admin-only features
- Mask sensitive fields (password hashes, 2FA secrets)
- Comprehensive audit logging for all admin actions

This plan builds upon the successful accountant management implementation while leveraging the
sophisticated database schema for comprehensive user administration capabilities.
