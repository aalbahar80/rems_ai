## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Create detailed user journey maps** for each core use case
2. **Design information architecture** with card sorting exercises
3. **Develop interactive wireframes** starting with the dashboard
4. **Plan progressive disclosure** for complex forms and workflows
5. **Design error states and edge cases** for all critical workflows

Your foundation is strong - you've identified the key portal separation and understood the
multi-tenant nature of the admin role. The next step is to detail the specific user journeys and
create low-fidelity wireframes for the core workflows you've identified.
