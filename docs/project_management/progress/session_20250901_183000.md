### **Dark Theme Fixes Applied**

#### **Admin Portal UI Improvements**

1. **Expense Categories Page**

   ```typescript
   // Fixed selected category contrast
   className={cn(
     'p-4 border rounded-lg cursor-pointer transition-all',
     category.selected
       ? 'border-admin-500 bg-admin-50 dark:bg-admin-900/20 dark:border-admin-600 dark:text-admin-100'
       : 'border-gray-200 hover:border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 dark:hover:border-gray-600'
   )}
   ```

2. **Currency Selection Page**

   ```typescript
   // Enhanced currency selection visibility
   className={cn(
     'p-4 border-2 rounded-lg cursor-pointer transition-all',
     currency.code === selectedCurrency
       ? 'border-admin-500 bg-admin-50 ring-2 ring-admin-200 dark:bg-admin-900/20 dark:border-admin-600 dark:ring-admin-800'
       : 'border-gray-200 hover:border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 dark:hover:border-gray-600'
   )}
   ```

3. **Business Rules Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // Improved toggle switch contrast
   <div className={cn(
     'relative inline-flex h-6 w-11 items-center rounded-full border-2 transition-colors',
     enabled ? 'bg-admin-500 border-admin-500' : 'bg-gray-200 border-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600'
   )}>
   ```

### **Problem Solving Approach**

#### **FormField Runtime Error Resolution**

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: The FormField component was receiving undefined props, causing "The
   argument must be a React element" error
2. **Solution Strategy**: Replaced FormField usage with direct Input components and proper label
   structure
3. **Implementation**: Created consistent form field patterns across all wizard steps
4. **Validation**: Ensured proper TypeScript typing and React component structure

#### **Navigation Flow Improvement**

1. **Issue Identification**: Dashboard button misleadingly labeled "Add Property" but should
   navigate to property management
2. **User Experience Fix**: Changed button text to "Manage Properties" and updated click handler
3. **Consistency**: Aligned navigation patterns across dashboard and property pages
