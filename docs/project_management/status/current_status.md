  multi-tenant architecture)
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Firm-based data isolation using firm_id foreign keys across all core tables
- **Ownership Model**: Flexible individual and firm-default ownership with percentage validation
- **Approval System**: Smart routing based on property ownership (owner vs admin approval)
- **API Design**: RESTful with /api/v1 versioning structure (needs multi-tenant adaptation)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication with user-firm assignment context
- **Port Strategy**: 3001 for API, 5432 for database (containerized)
- **Portal Architecture**: Multi-tenant portals (Admin, Accountant, Owner, Tenant) with firm context
  switching

### **Dependencies & Constraints**

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing schema
- Multi-language support required (English/Arabic)
- International tenant/owner support essential
