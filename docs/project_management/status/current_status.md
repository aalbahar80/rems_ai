-- Verify multi-tenant entities
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rems.firms;                     -- Current: 3 firms
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rems.user_firm_assignments;     -- Assignments table created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rems.approval_decisions;        -- Approval workflow ready
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rems.approval_delegations;      -- Delegation system ready

-- Verify enhanced existing tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rems.owners WHERE firm_id IS NOT NULL;      -- Firm assignments

```

### **Multi-Tenant Migration Progress**

**Completed Migrations (5/6):**

- ✅ **001**: Multi-tenant foundation (firms, user assignments, firm_id relationships)
- ✅ **002**: Enhanced ownership model (firm-default ownership, percentage validation)
- ✅ **003**: Approval workflow system (smart routing, 72-hour escalation)
- ✅ **004**: Tenant portal enhancements (payment preferences, communications, maintenance ratings)
- ✅ **005**: Portal-specific views (admin, accountant, owner, tenant dashboards and analytics)

## 🚨 Known Issues & Considerations

### **Current Issues**

- ✅ ~~Backend directory structure needs to be established~~ - RESOLVED
- ✅ ~~Database connection parameters need verification~~ - RESOLVED
- ✅ ~~Package dependencies need installation~~ - RESOLVED
- ✅ ~~JWT authentication system needs implementation~~ - RESOLVED
- ✅ ~~Core API endpoints need implementation~~ - RESOLVED
- ✅ ~~PostgreSQL syntax errors in migration files~~ - RESOLVED (wrapped in DO blocks)
- ✅ ~~Schema mismatch issues (table/column names)~~ - RESOLVED (adapted to actual schema)
- ⏳ **Migrations 004-006 need streamlined versions** adapted to actual database schema
- ⏳ **API guidance documentation required** for multi-tenant frontend development patterns

### **Architectural Decisions Made**

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with rems schema containing 73 tables (enhanced with multi-tenant
  support)
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Firm-based data isolation using firm_id foreign keys across all core tables
- **Ownership Model**: Flexible individual and firm-default ownership with percentage validation
- **Approval System**: Smart routing based on property ownership (owner vs admin approval)
- **API Design**: RESTful with /api/v1 versioning structure (needs multi-tenant adaptation)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication with user-firm assignment context
- **Port Strategy**: 3001 for API, 5432 for database (containerized)
- **Portal Architecture**: Multi-tenant portals (Admin, Accountant, Owner, Tenant) with firm context
  switching

### **Dependencies & Constraints**

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing schema
- Multi-language support required (English/Arabic)
- International tenant/owner support essential
